# The Basics
## Normalization, Themes, and Baseline

First, in order to ensure we start with a common set of styles, we include a [normalization stylesheet](http://git.io/normalize).

Second, we load a theme that sets variables to help determine what colors and fonts are used.

Third, we load a baseline stylesheet that adds a variety of handy mixins and functions, such as mixins for vendor classes.
