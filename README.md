# Introduction

Verse is a forward-looking CSS framework. It emphasizes simple, flat, and responsive design. Verse [doesn't care about 2009](./public/chapters/A1-older-browsers.md), preferring instead to provide an incentive for people to upgrade to state-of-the-art browsers.

# Installation

Right now, the only way to install Verse is to git clone it and then copy the Stylus files into your project.

    git clone https://github.com/pandastrike/verse.git

You can actually see the framework in action by loading it as a Web site. Just `cd` into the project directory and run:

    npm install && npm run-script server

Point your browser to `http://localhost:9000` and you can see the documentation for Verse, using the Verse CSS.
